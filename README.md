# Colombia-R-project

This was a project which followed a time-series data of Colombian Youths who were randomly chosen to participate in a Vocational
training scheme. The aim of the scheme was to help youths obtain well-paying jobs which would ultimately increase their 
"quality of living" through monetary means. They were followed up with 10 years after the program to see how they were doing 
socioeconomically. My project aims to decipher the data in a meaningful way which predicted and reflected the actual results which
were recorded/observed during the data collection process. This was a great way for me to incorporate the many regressional
analysis techniques I had learnt during the semester such as linear, logarithmic regressions and strengthened my foundation in 
R programming language.
